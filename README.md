#Meme Generator - React practice Project  
This is a solution to one of the Meme Generation projects that I did along side Bob Ziroll's course on Scrimba.
This is a part of learning React and understanding the use of Class components and Functional Components to separate the code based on its functionality.

## Overview
This is a meme generator that uses "https://api.imgflip.com/get_memes" to fetch memes from.
It takes users input text and picks a random meme url from the array of memes to generate an image to go with the users text.
